 Online Banking App ![Build Status]

Online Banking App is the revamped version of Web Self Service App. The app leverages standard web technologies and was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.7.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have the following installed in your system:

    [`git`](https://git-scm.com/)

    [`npm`](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

2. Install [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) globally.
```
npm install -g @angular/cli@9.1.7
```

3. Clone the project locally into your system.

```
npm install
```

6. To preview the app, run the following command and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
```
ng serve
```

The application is using the development server mobile instance with basic authentication by default. The credentials for the same are:
